import EmailProvider from "next-auth/providers/email";

export const authOptions = {
  adapter: SupabaseAdapter({
    url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL!,
    secret: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!,
  }),

interface SessionInfo {
  deviceType: string;
  browser: string;
  location?: string;
  lastActive: DateTime;
}
```

#### 3. Security Headers Enhancement (Immediate)
```typescript
// Recommended: Add security headers in Next.js config
const securityHeaders = [
  { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
  { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
  { key: 'X-XSS-Protection', value: '1; mode=block' },
];
```
