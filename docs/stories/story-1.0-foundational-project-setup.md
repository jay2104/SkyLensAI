## Story Metadata
- **Story ID**: 1.0
- **Epic**: Epic 1 - The Premium Visualizer & The Pro AI Teaser
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Done
- **Created**: 2025-07-28
- **Assigned to**: Developer Agent

## User Story
**As a** developer, **I want** to scaffold the new SkyLensAI project using the T3 Stack and connect it to our Supabase database, **so that** we have a solid, version-controlled foundation before building any features.

## Business Context
This foundational story establishes the technical infrastructure for the entire SkyLensAI project. Without this foundation, no subsequent features can be developed. The T3 Stack provides a type-safe, full-stack environment optimized for rapid development and deployment on Vercel.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: T3 Stack Project Initialization ✅
- [x] Project is initialized using the `npx create-t3-app` command with the following options:
  - TypeScript: Yes
  - NextAuth.js: Yes (for future authentication)
  - Prisma: Yes (for database ORM)
  - Tailwind CSS: Yes (for styling)
  - tRPC: Yes (for type-safe APIs)
  - App Router: Yes (Next.js 13+ routing)

### AC2: GitHub Repository Setup ✅
- [x] Create new GitHub repository named "SkyLensAI"
- [x] Initial T3 Stack code is committed and pushed to main branch
- [x] Repository includes proper .gitignore for Node.js/Next.js projects
- [x] README.md is updated with project-specific information

### AC3: Database Schema & Supabase Integration ✅
- [x] Supabase project is connected via environment variables:
  - `DATABASE_URL` configured in `.env`
  - `DIRECT_URL` configured for migrations
- [x] Prisma schema includes the complete data models from architecture:
  - User model with all attributes (id, email, name, subscriptionTier, etc.)
  - LogFile model with all attributes (id, fileName, fileType, uploadStatus, etc.)
  - AnalysisResult model with all attributes (id, status, healthScore, etc.)
  - All ENUMs defined (SubscriptionTier, UploadStatus, AnalysisStatus, LogFileType)
  - Proper relationships between models
- [x] Database migration successfully applied to Supabase:
  - `npx prisma db push` executes without errors
  - All tables created in Supabase dashboard
  - All indexes created on foreign keys

### AC4: Local Development Environment ✅
- [x] Application starts successfully with `npm run dev`
- [x] Application accessible at http://localhost:3000
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Database connection verified (can query empty tables)
- [x] Hot reload working for both frontend and backend changes

## Technical Requirements

### Required Technologies (from Architecture)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.3 with TypeScript 5.4.5
- **Backend**: tRPC 11.0.0-rc.355 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Prisma 5.14.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.3
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js 5.0.0-beta.19 (configured but not implemented)

### Environment Setup
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# NextAuth (for future use)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Supabase (for future file storage)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
```

## Database Schema Implementation

### Prisma Schema Structure
```prisma
// User model
model User {
  id                         String           @id @default(cuid())
  email                      String           @unique
  name                       String?
  subscriptionTier          SubscriptionTier @default(FREE)
  paymentProviderCustomerId String?
  createdAt                 DateTime         @default(now())
  updatedAt                 DateTime         @updatedAt
  
  // Relationships
  logFiles                  LogFile[]
  analysisResults           AnalysisResult[]
}

// Additional models for LogFile, AnalysisResult, and ENUMs...
```

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### User Responsibilities (Must be completed before development)
- **Supabase Account**: New project created with database credentials available
- **GitHub Repository**: Access permissions configured for development team

### Development Dependencies
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git configured with GitHub access
- Supabase project credentials available

## Definition of Done

✅ **Story is complete when:**
1. T3 Stack project successfully initialized with all specified technologies
2. Code committed to GitHub repository with proper project structure
3. Supabase database connected with complete schema deployed
4. Local development environment verified working
5. All tests pass (basic T3 Stack setup tests)
6. No TypeScript errors or warnings
7. Developer can run `npm run dev` and access working application

## Notes & Assumptions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using T3 Stack for rapid, type-safe development
- Supabase chosen for managed PostgreSQL + future file storage
- Prisma for type-safe database operations
- Following T3 Stack conventions for folder structure

### Potential Blockers
- Supabase account setup must be completed before development begins
- Database credentials must be securely provided to development team
- GitHub repository access must be configured

### Future Considerations
- Authentication implementation will be added in later stories
- File storage integration will be added when log upload features are developed
- CI/CD pipeline setup will be addressed in future infrastructure stories

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-27
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent foundational setup with high-quality implementation. The T3 Stack initialization follows best practices, with proper TypeScript configuration and modern Next.js patterns. The database schema is well-structured with appropriate relationships, indexes, and cascading deletes. All acceptance criteria have been thoroughly implemented.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring required - the implementation demonstrates senior-level code quality and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ No specific coding standards document found, but code follows T3 Stack conventions
- Project Structure: ⚠️ Deviation from architectural plan - using `skylensai/` instead of expected `apps/nextjs/` structure
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ No testing strategy document found, minimal test setup in T3 Stack
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist
[All items properly addressed by the developer]

- [x] T3 Stack project successfully initialized with all required technologies
- [x] Database schema properly implemented with all models, enums, and relationships
- [x] Environment variable validation correctly configured
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] Build process works successfully
- [x] README updated with project-specific information

### Security Review
✓ **Secure implementation:**
- Environment variables properly validated using zod schemas
- Database credentials not exposed in code
- NextAuth.js properly configured for future authentication
- Prisma relationships use proper cascade deletes to prevent orphaned records

### Performance Considerations
✓ **Well-optimized setup:**
- Database indexes properly configured on foreign keys (userId, logFileId)
- Prisma client generation configured for optimal performance
- Next.js build optimizations enabled (Turbo mode in dev)
- Static generation working correctly for applicable pages

### Notable Observations
1. **Project Structure Deviation**: The actual structure uses `skylensai/` as root instead of the planned `apps/nextjs/` monorepo structure. This should be documented or corrected in future iterations.

2. **Missing Documentation**: No coding standards or testing strategy documents exist yet, which is acceptable for foundational setup but should be prioritized.

3. **Excellent Schema Design**: The Prisma schema demonstrates thoughtful design with proper ENUMs, relationships, and NextAuth integration.

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

This foundational setup exceeds expectations with clean, production-ready code that follows industry best practices. The developer has demonstrated excellent attention to detail and thorough implementation of all requirements.
