### Data Models Extensions

**LogFile Model Extensions** (extend existing):
```prisma
model LogFile {
  // ... existing fields (id, fileName, fileType, uploadStatus, fileSize, userId, createdAt)
  
  // Add dashboard-specific summary fields:
  flightDuration      Float?    // Duration in seconds
  maxAltitude        Float?    // Maximum altitude in meters
  totalDistance      Float?    // Total distance traveled in meters
  batteryStartVoltage Float?   // Starting battery voltage
  batteryEndVoltage   Float?   // Ending battery voltage
  gpsQuality         Int?      // Average GPS signal quality
  flightModes        Json?     // Array of flight mode changes
  
  // Relationships (existing + new):
  user              User               @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  analysisResult    AnalysisResult?
  timeSeriesData    TimeSeriesPoint[]  // New relationship
  
  @@index([userId])
}
```

**TimeSeriesPoint Model (New)**:
```prisma
model TimeSeriesPoint {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  logFileId   String
  timestamp   Float    // Time offset in seconds
  parameter   String   // e.g., "altitude", "battery_voltage", "gps_lat"
  value       Float    // Parameter value
  unit        String   // Unit of measurement
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  // Relationships
  logFile     LogFile  @relation(fields: [logFileId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@index([logFileId, parameter])
}
```
