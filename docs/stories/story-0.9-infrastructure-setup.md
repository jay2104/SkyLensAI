# Story 0.9: Infrastructure Setup & Service Configuration

## Story Metadata
- **Story ID**: 0.9
- **Epic**: Epic 1 - The Premium Visualizer & The Pro AI Teaser
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Done
- **Created**: 2025-07-29
- **Assigned to**: Developer Agent (with User prerequisites)

## User Story
**As a** developer, **I want** to configure all external service integrations and database connections **so that** the application has working infrastructure before implementing any user-facing features.

## Business Context
This foundational story ensures all external dependencies are properly configured before development begins. Without proper infrastructure setup, subsequent stories will fail during implementation. This story must be completed immediately after Story 1.0 (project scaffolding) and before Story 1.1 (multi-modal input).

## Prerequisites (User Responsibilities)
**⚠️ CRITICAL: These tasks MUST be completed by the user before developer agent can proceed:**

### SUPABASE SETUP
1. **Create Supabase Account**
   - Go to https://supabase.com and create free account
   - Create new project named "skylensai-production"
   - Save the project URL and anon key provided

2. **Configure Database**
   - Navigate to SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard
   - Run the database schema creation script (will be provided by dev agent)
   - Enable Row Level Security on all tables

3. **Setup Storage Bucket**
   - Go to Storage → Create new bucket named "log-files"
   - Set bucket to private (not public)
   - Configure upload policies for authenticated users

### VERCEL SETUP
4. **Create Vercel Account**
   - Go to https://vercel.com and create account
   - Connect GitHub account for deployment access
   - Note: Actual deployment will happen in later story

### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
5. **Gather Required Credentials**
   - Supabase Project URL
   - Supabase Anon Key

## Notes for Developer Agent

This story CANNOT be started until the user completes all prerequisite tasks. The story should fail fast if any external service is not properly configured. Focus on creating robust validation and clear error messages to help users troubleshoot configuration issues.

All subsequent stories depend on this infrastructure being properly established.
