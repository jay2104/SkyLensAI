- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Done
- **Created**: 2025-07-28
- **Updated**: 2025-07-29 (Authentication integration complete - Ready for QA)
- **Assigned to**: Developer Agent

## Status
**Current Status**: Done ✅ (QA Review Complete - Approved for Production)

## Prerequisites (UPDATED 2025-07-29)
- **MUST COMPLETE:** Story 0.9 (Infrastructure Setup) - Database and storage configuration
- **MUST COMPLETE:** Story 1.05 (Authentication Integration) - User association for uploads

## User Story
**As a** new user, **I want** a simple, browser-based interface to either upload a log file or type in my issue in plain text, **so that** I can begin my analysis using whatever information I have available.

## Business Context
This story creates the primary user entry point to the SkyLensAI application. It enables users to provide input through two modalities - file upload for users with actual log files, and text input for users who only have a description of their issue. This flexibility maximizes user adoption by accommodating different user scenarios and data availability.
