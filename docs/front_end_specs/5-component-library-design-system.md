# **5. Component Library / Design System**

## **Design System Approach**

For our initial launch, we will create a custom, project-specific component library. We will start with a lean set of core components required to build the MVP (Epic 1) and will expand the library as the product grows.

## **Core Components (for MVP)**

  * **Buttons:** (Primary, Secondary, Text variants)
  * **Input Fields:** (For text query, login/signup forms)
  * **Graph/Chart Component:** A highly optimized and beautifully designed component for time-series data.
  * **Timeline Event Component:** The visual representation of an event on our "Intelligent Flight Timeline."
  * **Panel/Modal Component:** A container for displaying detailed AI analysis.
