# **3. User Flows**

## **Flow: First-Time Log Analysis & Pro Feature Discovery**

  * **User Goal:** As a new user, I want to upload a log, understand my vehicle's health, and see the value of the Pro features.
  * **Entry Points:** Homepage / Universal Input
  * **Success Criteria:** The user successfully views their dashboard, understands the free AI health summary, and knows how to upgrade to get a detailed solution.
  * **Strategic Rationale:** We show the high-quality dashboard *first* to establish credibility as a serious engineering tool before introducing the AI. This builds a foundation of trust.
  * **Key UX Elements:** The flow will use engaging notification elements (e.g., a subtle glow on the "AI Insights" button) to guide user curiosity.
