## **Design Concept: "The Mission Control Cockpit"**

The design vision is to create an immersive, professional, and data-rich experience inspired by aerospace and high-tech analytics tools.

## **Design Process**

The visual design will not be created by a one-shot AI generator. Instead, we will follow a professional, iterative design process:

1.  **Detailed Specification:** Sally (UX Expert) will create a highly detailed written design specification for each component, describing the exact visual properties, animations, and interactions.
2.  **Developer Implementation:** The spec will be handed to a Developer Agent, whose job is to translate the design into code.
3.  **Collaborative Review:** The implemented component will be reviewed by the user and Sally to ensure it is pixel-perfect and matches the creative vision. This loop is repeated until the quality standard is met.
