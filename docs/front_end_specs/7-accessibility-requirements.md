# **7. Accessibility Requirements**

## **Accessibility Approach**

Our approach to accessibility will be one of informed consideration. We will use the WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as a reference to guide our design choices, with the goal of creating a broadly usable product, but we are not committing to full, certifiable compliance. Our primary goal is a great design that is usable by as many people as possible.
