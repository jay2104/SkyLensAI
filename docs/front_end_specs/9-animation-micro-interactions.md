# **9. Animation & Micro-interactions**

## **Motion Principles**

  * **Responsive & Fast:** Animations will be quick and serve to make the interface feel faster.
  * **Informative, Not Decorative:** Motion will have a purpose, such as guiding the user's eye or providing feedback.
  * **Consistent & Thematic:** All animations will follow a consistent style that reinforces the professional "Mission Control" feel.

## **Key Animations**

  * **Timeline Event Pulse:** Warning and critical events will have a subtle, professional glowing pulse.
  * **Graph Zoom Animation:** The graph will smoothly animate to the corresponding time range when a timeline event is clicked.
  * **Hover Effects:** Interactive elements will have subtle and smooth scaling effects.
