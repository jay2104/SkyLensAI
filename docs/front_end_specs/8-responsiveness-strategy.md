# **8. Responsiveness Strategy**

## **Core Principle**

"No compromises, no matter the device." The experience will feel premium and fully-featured across all our target platforms.

## **Breakpoints**

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Devices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mobile | 320px | Small Phones (Secondary Priority) |
| Tablet | 768px | iPads, Tablets |
| Desktop | 1024px | Laptops, Small Monitors (Primary Target) |
| Wide | 1536px | Large Desktop Monitors |

## **Adaptation Patterns**

  * The layout will adapt intelligently for smaller screens. The "Telemetry Bar" may stack on top of the graph view, and main navigation may collapse into a "hamburger" menu to save space and maintain usability.
