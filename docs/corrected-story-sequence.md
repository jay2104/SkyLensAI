# Corrected Story Sequence & Dependencies

## Overview
This document defines the corrected story sequence that addresses all critical dependency issues identified in the PO Master Checklist. Each story now has proper prerequisites and clear blocking relationships.

## üéØ Epic 1: The Premium Visualizer & The Pro AI Teaser

### Corrected Story Sequence

#### **Story 1.0: Foundational Project Setup** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Status:** Done
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Blocks:** All subsequent stories
- **Critical Elements:** T3 Stack scaffolding, Git repository, basic project structure

---

#### **Story 0.9: Infrastructure Setup & Service Configuration** üö® NEW - CRITICAL
- **Status:** To Do (MUST complete before any other stories)
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Story 1.0 (Foundational Setup) ‚úÖ
  - USER PREREQUISITES: Supabase account, Vercel account, credentials gathered
- **Blocks:** Stories 1.05, 1.1, 1.2 (all database-dependent features)
- **Critical Elements:**
  - Database connection and schema deployment
  - Supabase Storage configuration
  - Environment variable setup and validation
  - Service integration testing

**‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE:** This story MUST be inserted before any database operations. Original sequence started database usage in Story 1.1 without proper setup.

---

#### **Story 1.05: Authentication System Integration** üö® NEW - CRITICAL
- **Status:** To Do
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Story 0.9 (Infrastructure Setup) - Database and NextAuth configuration required
- **Blocks:** All user-specific functionality in Stories 1.1 and 1.2
- **Critical Elements:**
  - NextAuth with Supabase adapter
  - User registration and login flows
  - Protected route middleware
  - Session management

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY FIX:** Authentication must be established before user data association in file uploads and dashboard.

---

#### **Story 1.1: Multi-Modal Data Input** ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED DEPENDENCIES
- **Status:** Done (BUT needs user association update)
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Story 1.05 (Authentication) - Required for user-associated uploads
  - Story 0.9 (Infrastructure) - Required for database and storage operations
- **Blocks:** Story 1.2 (Dashboard requires uploaded data)
- **Required Updates:**
  - Associate uploaded files with authenticated users
  - Update tRPC procedures to include user authorization
  - Add user-specific file listing

**üîß REFACTOR NEEDED:** Current implementation may lack proper user association. Requires update after authentication is implemented.

---

#### **Story 1.2: Vehicle Health Dashboard** ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED DEPENDENCIES  
- **Status:** Done (BUT needs user scoping update)
- **Dependencies:**
  - Story 1.1 (Multi-Modal Input) - Requires uploaded log data
  - Story 1.05 (Authentication) - Required for user-specific dashboard
  - Story 0.9 (Infrastructure) - Required for database operations
- **Blocks:** Future premium features
- **Required Updates:**
  - Add user authorization to dashboard routes
  - Scope dashboard data to authenticated user
  - Add user-specific log file filtering

**üîß REFACTOR NEEDED:** Current implementation may show all data instead of user-specific data.

## üìã Dependency Matrix

| Story | Requires | Blocks | Critical Path |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1.0 | None | All others | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 0.9 | 1.0, User Setup | 1.05, 1.1, 1.2 | üö® Must Do Next |
| 1.05 | 0.9 | 1.1, 1.2 | üö® Critical |
| 1.1 | 0.9, 1.05 | 1.2 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Update |
| 1.2 | 0.9, 1.05, 1.1 | Future features | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Update |

## üö® Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. **Infrastructure Setup Gap** - RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Stories 1.1 and 1.2 used database without explicit setup
- **Solution:** Added Story 0.9 with comprehensive infrastructure configuration
- **Impact:** Prevents deployment failures and configuration errors

### 2. **Authentication Sequence** - RESOLVED  
- **Problem:** User-specific features implemented without authentication
- **Solution:** Added Story 1.05 before any user data operations
- **Impact:** Enables proper data security and user association

### 3. **External Service Dependencies** - RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Service setup tasks not assigned to users
- **Solution:** Created user setup guide with clear prerequisites
- **Impact:** Prevents blockers from missing external service configuration

### 4. **Database Dependency Chain** - RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Database operations before schema deployment
- **Solution:** Explicit database setup in Story 0.9 before usage
- **Impact:** Ensures working database before any operations

## üìù Required Story Updates

### Story 1.1 Updates Needed
```typescript
// Add user authorization to file upload
export const logFileRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  upload: protectedProcedure // <- Add authentication
    .input(uploadSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Associate with ctx.session.user.id
    }),
});
```

### Story 1.2 Updates Needed  
```typescript
// Add user scoping to dashboard data
export const dashboardRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  getLogFiles: protectedProcedure // <- Add authentication
    .query(async ({ ctx }) => {
      return ctx.db.logFile.findMany({
        where: { userId: ctx.session.user.id }, // <- User scoping
      });
    }),
});
```

## ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] **User completes external service setup** (user-setup-guide.md)
- [ ] **Implement Story 0.9** (Infrastructure Setup)
- [ ] **Implement Story 1.05** (Authentication Integration)
- [ ] **Update Story 1.1** (Add user association to uploads)
- [ ] **Update Story 1.2** (Add user scoping to dashboard)

### Validation Steps
- [ ] Database connection working before any database operations
- [ ] Authentication working before any user-specific features
- [ ] File uploads properly associated with users
- [ ] Dashboard data properly scoped to authenticated user
- [ ] All external services configured and functional

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Story Sequence Validation
1. **No story begins work that depends on incomplete prerequisites**
2. **All external dependencies explicitly handled before usage**
3. **User authentication established before user data operations**
4. **Database setup completed before database usage**
5. **Clear assignment of user vs. agent responsibilities**

### Technical Validation
1. **Story 0.9:** All services connect successfully in development
2. **Story 1.05:** Users can register, login, and access protected routes
3. **Story 1.1 Update:** File uploads create user-associated records
4. **Story 1.2 Update:** Dashboard shows only current user's data
5. **Integration:** Complete user journey works end-to-end

## üìà Future Story Planning

### Next Epic Preparation
With corrected foundation:
- Premium AI features can properly check user subscription tier
- User data is properly isolated and secure
- External service integrations are robust and tested
- Infrastructure can scale with user growth

This corrected sequence ensures a solid foundation for all future development while maintaining security and data integrity best practices.
