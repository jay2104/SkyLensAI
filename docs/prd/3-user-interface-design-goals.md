# **3. User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**
The user experience must be clean, intuitive, and professional, designed to build trust with a technical audience. The primary goal is to transform complex log data into easily understandable insights. The UI should feel like a helpful expert partner, not a complex engineering tool.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**
* **Guided Analysis:** The user journey is simple: upload a log, see a beautiful visualization, and receive clear insights.
* **Progressive Disclosure & Expert Views:** The default view is simple, with advanced views available for experts.
* **Trust Through Transparency:** AI insights are presented with confidence scores and source links.
* **Seamless Pro Experience:** Instead of gating a "report," paying users will "supercharge" the entire tool. Pro features will be integrated contextually throughout the interface—as new graph overlays, advanced analysis options, or deeper diagnostic tabs—which can be unlocked to transform the tool into its full-power mode.
