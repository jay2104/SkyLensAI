# UI/UX Specification: SkyLensAI

### **1. Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the SkyLensAI user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

#### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

* **Target User Personas (Final):**
    * **The First-Time Builder (New to the Hobby):** New to Ardupilot/PX4. They are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data and parameters. Their primary pain point is being asked by the community to provide graphs and data they don't understand. Our tool must be their first clear, simple guide to diagnosing problems.
    * **The Hobbyist:** An experienced enthusiast who is comfortable with the basics but not a developer. They want to solve problems and optimize their vehicle's performance.
    * **The Power User / Expert Hobbyist:** A deeply experienced user who is not a core developer but has significant technical knowledge. They want powerful tools for deep manual analysis.
    * **The Professional Technician:** An R&D engineer, commercial pilot, or repair technician. Their job depends on efficiency and accuracy. They need the fastest path to a reliable diagnosis.
    * **The Academic Researcher:** Uses the platform for data collection and analysis for novel research. They need flexibility and access to raw data.
    * **The Core Developer / Maintainer:** A developer contributing to the Ardupilot or PX4 codebases. They need a tool for deep, low-level debugging.

* **Usability Goals:**
    * **Clarity:** Transform complex data into understandable information.
    * **Efficiency:** Provide the fastest path from problem to solution.
    * **Trust:** Be a reliable, professional, and transparent tool.

* **Persona-Specific Goals:**
    * **For the New User:** The UI must reduce intimidation, offer a guided experience, and build their confidence.
    * **For the Hobbyist:** The UI must make them feel smart and empowered, helping them solve problems on their own.
    * **For the Power User:** The UI must be fast, keyboard-friendly, and provide dense information without feeling cluttered. It must reward their expertise.
    * **For the Professional:** The UI must be a reliable, "pro-grade" instrument. It must never feel like a toy. Data accuracy and speed are paramount.
    * **For the Researcher/Developer:** The UI must allow for deep customization and provide easy ways to export raw data for external analysis.

* **Design Principles (Final List):**
    1.  **Guide, Don't Overwhelm:** Start simple, reveal complexity on demand.
    2.  **Trust Through Transparency:** Show the evidence behind the AI's conclusions.
    3.  **Delight in the Details:** A premium feel through performance and polish.
    4.  **Surface Value Contextually:** Seamlessly showcase the benefits of Pro features at the user's point of need.
    5.  **The No-Brainer Upgrade:** The value proposition for Pro must be so strong that the user feels they are making a smart investment, not just a purchase.

## **3. User Flows**

### **Flow: First-Time Log Analysis & Pro Feature Discovery**

  * **User Goal:** As a new user, I want to upload a log, understand my vehicle's health, and see the value of the Pro features.
  * **Entry Points:** Homepage / Universal Input
  * **Success Criteria:** The user successfully views their dashboard, understands the free AI health summary, and knows how to upgrade to get a detailed solution.
  * **Strategic Rationale:** We show the high-quality dashboard *first* to establish credibility as a serious engineering tool before introducing the AI. This builds a foundation of trust.
  * **Key UX Elements:** The flow will use engaging notification elements (e.g., a subtle glow on the "AI Insights" button) to guide user curiosity.

## **4. Wireframes & Mockups**

### **Design Concept: "The Mission Control Cockpit"**

The design vision is to create an immersive, professional, and data-rich experience inspired by aerospace and high-tech analytics tools.

### **Design Process**

The visual design will not be created by a one-shot AI generator. Instead, we will follow a professional, iterative design process:

1.  **Detailed Specification:** Sally (UX Expert) will create a highly detailed written design specification for each component, describing the exact visual properties, animations, and interactions.
2.  **Developer Implementation:** The spec will be handed to a Developer Agent, whose job is to translate the design into code.
3.  **Collaborative Review:** The implemented component will be reviewed by the user and Sally to ensure it is pixel-perfect and matches the creative vision. This loop is repeated until the quality standard is met.

## **5. Component Library / Design System**

### **Design System Approach**

For our initial launch, we will create a custom, project-specific component library. We will start with a lean set of core components required to build the MVP (Epic 1) and will expand the library as the product grows.

### **Core Components (for MVP)**

  * **Buttons:** (Primary, Secondary, Text variants)
  * **Input Fields:** (For text query, login/signup forms)
  * **Graph/Chart Component:** A highly optimized and beautifully designed component for time-series data.
  * **Timeline Event Component:** The visual representation of an event on our "Intelligent Flight Timeline."
  * **Panel/Modal Component:** A container for displaying detailed AI analysis.

## **6. Branding & Style Guide**

### **Visual Identity**

The visual identity for SkyLensAI will convey trust, intelligence, and precision. The aesthetic will be clean, data-focused, and modern.

### **Color Palette (with Semantic Tokens)**

  * **Default Theme:** Light theme. Dark and System settings will be available.
  * `color-text-primary`: Dark Gray (`#0F172A`)
  * `color-background-primary`: White (`#FFFFFF`)
  * `color-action-primary`: Blue (`#2563EB`)
  * `color-action-accent`: Orange (`#F97316`) - **Used for "Upgrade" and key CTAs.**
  * `color-semantic-success`: Green (`#22C55E`)
  * `color-semantic-warning`: Amber (`#F59E0B`)
  * `color-semantic-error`: Red (`#EF4444`)

### **Typography**

  * **Primary Font Family:** **Inter**. Rationale: A clean, modern, and highly readable sans-serif font ideal for UIs.

### **Iconography**

  * **Icon Library:** **Lucide Icons**. Rationale: A comprehensive, open-source icon set with a professional aesthetic.

### **Spacing & Layout**

  * **Grid System:** A standard 8-point grid system will be used to ensure all spacing and alignment is consistent and harmonious.

## **7. Accessibility Requirements**

### **Accessibility Approach**

Our approach to accessibility will be one of informed consideration. We will use the WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as a reference to guide our design choices, with the goal of creating a broadly usable product, but we are not committing to full, certifiable compliance. Our primary goal is a great design that is usable by as many people as possible.

## **8. Responsiveness Strategy**

### **Core Principle**

"No compromises, no matter the device." The experience will feel premium and fully-featured across all our target platforms.

### **Breakpoints**

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Devices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mobile | 320px | Small Phones (Secondary Priority) |
| Tablet | 768px | iPads, Tablets |
| Desktop | 1024px | Laptops, Small Monitors (Primary Target) |
| Wide | 1536px | Large Desktop Monitors |

### **Adaptation Patterns**

  * The layout will adapt intelligently for smaller screens. The "Telemetry Bar" may stack on top of the graph view, and main navigation may collapse into a "hamburger" menu to save space and maintain usability.

## **9. Animation & Micro-interactions**

### **Motion Principles**

  * **Responsive & Fast:** Animations will be quick and serve to make the interface feel faster.
  * **Informative, Not Decorative:** Motion will have a purpose, such as guiding the user's eye or providing feedback.
  * **Consistent & Thematic:** All animations will follow a consistent style that reinforces the professional "Mission Control" feel.

### **Key Animations**

  * **Timeline Event Pulse:** Warning and critical events will have a subtle, professional glowing pulse.
  * **Graph Zoom Animation:** The graph will smoothly animate to the corresponding time range when a timeline event is clicked.
  * **Hover Effects:** Interactive elements will have subtle and smooth scaling effects.

## **10. Next Steps**

This UI/UX Specification is now complete. It will serve as the primary input for the frontend development team. The next steps are:

1.  Use the "Detailed Design Specification" process to design and implement each key component, starting with the `IntelligentFlightTimeline`.
2.  Develop the frontend application following the patterns and principles laid out in this document and the main Architecture Document.
