# **8. AI Architecture**

Our strategy is based on a modern pattern called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

  * **The Brain (LLMs):** We will use a powerful Large Language Model to understand user queries and generate answers.
  * **The Specialized Library (Our Knowledge Graph):** Our proprietary pipeline will build a curated and validated database of drone-specific knowledge.
  * **The RAG Pattern:** We will use the RAG pattern to connect the LLM to our specialized library. This forces the AI to ground its answers in our validated data, preventing "hallucinations" and ensuring its answers are trustworthy and traceable to a source. This approach is faster, cheaper, more flexible, and provides a more trustworthy user experience than fine-tuning a custom model for our use case.
