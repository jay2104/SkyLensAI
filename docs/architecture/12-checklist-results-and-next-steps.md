# **12. Checklist Results and Next Steps**

The **Architect Solution Validation Checklist** has been run against this document. The architecture is confirmed to be robust, scalable, pragmatic, and tightly aligned with all product requirements. All identified risks have a clear mitigation strategy. The architecture is **Ready for Development**.

The next step is for the Scrum Master to take this document and the PRD to create the first development stories for Epic 1.
